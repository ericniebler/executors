Abstract:           This paper proposes a programming model for executors, which are modular components for creating execution, and senders, which are lazy descriptions of execution.

------------------------------------------------------

## Changelog

### Revision 11

As directed by SG1 at the 2019-07 Cologne meeting, we have implemented the following changes suggested by P1658 and P1660 which incorporate "lazy" execution:

* Introduced `set_value`, `set_error`, `set_done`, `execute`, `submit`, and `bulk_execute` customization point objects.
* Introduced `executor`, `executor_of`, `receiver`, `receiver_of`, `sender`, `sender_to`, `typed_sender`, and `scheduler` concepts.
* Renamed polymorphic executor to `any_executor`.
* Introduced `invocable_archetype`.
* Eliminated interface-changing properties `oneway_t` and `bulk_oneway_t`.
* Eliminated `OneWayExecutor` and `BulkOneWayExecutor` requirements.
* Eliminated `is_executor`, `is_oneway_executor`, and `is_bulk_oneway_executor` type traits.
* Eliminated interface-changing properties from `any_executor`.

### Revision 10

As directed by LEWG at the 2018-11 San Diego meeting, we have migrated the property customization mechanism to namespace `std` and moved all of the details of its specification to a separate paper, [P1393](http://wg21.link/P1393).  This change also included the introduction of a separate customization point for interface-enforcing properties, `require_concept`.  The generalization also necessitated the introduction of `is_applicable_property_v` in the properties paper, which in turn led to the introduction of `is_executor_v` to express the applicability of properties in this paper.

### Revision 9

As directed by the SG1/LEWG straw poll taken during the 2018 Bellevue executors
meeting, we have separated The Unified Executors programming model proposal into two
papers. This paper contains material related to one-way execution which the
authors hope to standardize with C++20 as suggested by the Bellevue poll.
[P1244](http://wg21.link/P1244) contains remaining material related to
dependent execution. We expect P1244 to evolve as committee consensus builds
around a design for dependent execution.

This revision also contains bug fixes to the `allocator_t` property which were originally scheduled for Revision 7 but were inadvertently omitted.

### Revision 8

Revision 8 of this proposal makes interface-changing properties such as `oneway` mutually exclusive in order to simplify implementation requirements for executor adaptors such as polymorphic executors.
Additionally, this revision clarifies wording regarding execution agent lifetime.

### Revision 7

Revision 7 of this proposal corrects wording bugs discovered by the authors after Revision 6's publication.

* Enhanced `static_query_v` to result in a default property value for executors which do not provide a `query` function for the property of interest
* Revise `then_execute` and `bulk_then_execute`'s operational semantics to allow user functions to handle incoming exceptions thrown by preceding execution agents
* Introduce `exception_arg` to disambiguate the user function's exceptional overload from its nonexceptional overload in `then_execute` and `bulk_then_execute`

### Revision 6

Revision 6 of this proposal corrects bugs and omissions discovered by the authors after Revision 5's publication, and introduces an enhancement improving the safety of the design.

* Enforce mutual exclusion of behavioral properties via the type system instead of via convention
* Introduce missing `execution::require` adaptations
* Allow executors to opt-out of invoking factory functions when appropriate
* Various bug fixes and corrections

### Revision 5

Revision 5 of this proposal responds to feedback requested during the 2017 Albuquerque ISO C++ Standards Committee meeting and introduces changes which allow properties to better interoperate with polymorphic executor wrappers and also simplify `execution::require`'s behavior.

* Defined general property type requirements
* Elaborated specification of standard property types
* Simplified `execution::require`'s specification
* Enhanced polymorphic executor wrapper
    * Templatized `execution::executor<SupportableProperties...>`
    * Introduced `prefer_only` property adaptor
* Responded to Albuquerque feedback
    * From SG1
        * Execution contexts are now optional properties of executors
        * Eliminated ill-specified caller-agent forward progress properties
        * Elaborated `Future`'s requirements to incorporate forward progress
        * Reworded operational semantics of execution functions to use similar language as the blocking properties
        * Elaborated `static_thread_pool`'s specification to guarantee that threads in the bool boost-block their work
        * Elaborated operational semantics of execution functions to note that forward progress guarantees are specific to the concrete executor type
    * From LEWG
        * Eliminated named `BaseExecutor` concept
        * Simplified general executor requirements
        * Enhanced the `OneWayExecutor` introductory paragraph
        * Eliminated `has_*_member` type traits
* Minor changes
    * Renamed TS namespace from `concurrency_v2` to `executors_v1`
    * Introduced `static_query_v` enabling static queries
    * Eliminated unused `property_value` trait
    * Eliminated the names `allocator_wrapper_t` and `default_allocator`

### Revision 4

* Specified the guarantees implied by `bulk_sequenced_execution`, `bulk_parallel_execution`, and `bulk_unsequenced_execution`

### Revision 3

* Introduced `execution::query()` for executor property introspection
* Simplified the design of `execution::prefer()`
* `oneway`, `twoway`, `single`, and `bulk` are now `require()`-only properties
* Introduced properties allowing executors to opt into adaptations that add blocking semantics
* Introduced properties describing the forward progress relationship between caller and agents
* Various minor improvements to existing functionality based on prototyping

### Revision 2

* Separated wording from explanatory prose, now contained in paper [P0761](https://wg21.link/P0761)
* Applied the simplification proposed by paper [P0688](https://wg21.link/P0688)

### Revision 1

* Executor category simplification
* Specified executor customization points in detail
* Introduced new fine-grained executor type traits
    * Detectors for execution functions
    * Traits for introspecting cross-cutting concerns
        * Introspection of mapping of agents to threads
        * Introspection of execution function blocking behavior
* Allocator support for single agent execution functions
* Renamed `thread_pool` to `static_thread_pool`
* New introduction

### Revision 0

* Initial design
